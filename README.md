# Java-Study-Kit-2021
# this study kit was written by C++.
(It's Windows only)
# Why I create this project?
 I'm too lazy to download and install an IDE application,so that I decided to write some projects to compose a simplized 'IDE'.
# How to use?
 The Earliest Version is very very simple. 
 You should download Java SE from Oracle's website and install it.
 Then, just download the files we provided and put it into a folder called "JavaProjects" on you desktop(if you don't have it just create one).
 in the folder, you shuold creat another folder called "Sample".
 # Be sure that the folders are like this
    JavaProjects
      -Sample
        -Initializing.exe
        -JavaRun.java
      -compiler.exe 
#  and then , you just need to run the "Initializing.exe"
     JavaProjects
      -Sample
        -Initializing.exe
        -JavaRun.java
      -compiler.exe 
      -JavaRun.java
and write your project in the "JavaRun.java" which have been copied to JavaProjects justnow.
After that , save it and run "compiler.exe" , you did it.
